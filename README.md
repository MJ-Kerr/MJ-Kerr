## I am Miles Kerr,

### I am relativly new to the developer life. Just got done with Coding Dojo, and wow that was a whirlwind.

### The bootcamp taught me a lot about what I was capable of when I put my  mind to it. As somebody who didn't really play around with coding before I got started, it was remarkable how well I was able to excel without the years of coding my cohort mates had. Imagine I didn't even own a computer a year and a half a go, and now I'm looking for my first job in tech.

### In my past life I was a bartender so I know what its like to have a million things on your plate and people keep giving you more. This skill has helped me with building applications that have multiple different features running at the same time, since I am used to multi-tasking.

### If you stumbled upon my GitHub thank you please check out my portfolio site at www.TheMJKDesign.com. I built it using React with 3js, which wasn't taught at Coding Dojo, during a week off that we had.

## What I am working on now--
